## General Information


Problem Statement

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes wants to predict the demand for shared bikes among the people after this Covid-19 is over since demand has gonr down due to covid and revenue has decreased. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers 
and make huge profits.

Business Goal:
It is required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.. 

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10.4
- jupyter notebook
- Google Colab


## Conclusions
Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes are

holiday, temp, hum, windspeed, Season, months(January, July, September, November, December), Year (2019), Sunday, weathersit( Light Snow, Mist + Cloudy)
